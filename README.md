# My-Middleware-API

## Description
A sample approach for implementing an XML-to-JSON API proxy server with a single REST HTTP endpoint using NestJS with NodeJS/Typescript,
for evaluation. Initial scaffolding of the application was also provided by NestJS (via )

The following diagram illustrates its behaviour:

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Development PC Prequisites
Building and running the application on a local PC assumes the following:
1. NodeJS v20+ is installed
2. NestJS CLI is installed, via running:
```bash
npm install -g @nestjs/cli
```

## 3rd-Party Dependencies
1. fast-xml-parser - to automatically convert XML responses to analogous JSON structure
2. express-openapi-validator - automatically validates API requests and responses against a provided OpenAPI 3 specification 
3. class-validator - used to validate responses against defined CompanyDto using class-validator decorators


## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

### GitHub Actions test
GitHub actions workflows have also been configured for this project to run tests as per:
1. Unit tests - On pushing changes to any feature/* branch
2. E2E (integraetion) tests - On creating a Pull Request

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.
